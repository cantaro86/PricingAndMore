Just a repo for my testing of C++

It includes 

- Binary option pricer for European and American options. 
  It uses Monte Carlo, Finite differences methods and Finite Elements methods.

- The discretization for FEM is described in docs. For the FEM approach, I first map the problem to 
  a heat equation and then use the FEM discretization.

- A closed formula (non-recursive) for the Fibonacci numbers.
